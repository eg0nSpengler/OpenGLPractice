# OpenGLPractice
Just for fun. A small opengl program that displays a triangle

## That's cool but, how do I make my own OpenGL triangle?

I followed the guide linked [here](https://learnopengl.com/Introduction)

This was a rather humbling experience since it taught me that Graphics Programmers have a bit more patience than I do.

Although someday I'll probably make a return if I want to brush up on 2D/3D rendering techniques and logic.
